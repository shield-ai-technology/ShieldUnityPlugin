           Name of the Cocoapod.
         * "path" (optional)
           Path to the local Cocoapod.
           NOTE: This is expanded to a local path when the Podfile is generated.
           For example, if a Unity project has the root path "/my/game" and the
           pod the path is "foo/bar", this will be will be expanded to
           "/my/game/foo/bar" when the Podfile is generated.
         * "version" (optional)
           Cocoapod version specification for the named pod.
           If this is not specified the latest version is used.
           NOTE: This can't be used when "path" is set.
         * "bitcodeEnabled" (optional)
           Whether this Cocoapod requires bitcode to be enabled in Unity's
           generated Xcode project.  This is "true" by default.
         * "minTargetSdk" (optional)
           The minimum iOS SDK required by this Cocoapod.
         * "addToAllTargets" (optional)
           Whether to add this pod to all targets when multiple target is
           supported. This is "false" by default.
         * "configurations" (optional)
           Podfile formatted list of configurations to include this pod in.
         * "modular_headers" (optional)
           Set to true to enable modular headers, false to disable.
         * "source" (optional)
